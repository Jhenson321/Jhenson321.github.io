         <p>I am a Sophmore cinema student at Bob Jones University and I have a twin.</p>
         <p>
            I hope to graduate collage with my twin and start up a production company together. He wants to write scripts and I want to direct (Lord willing). I have a good sense of humor and a big personality.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I am also one of 5 siblings in my family. We have two dogs, one cat, 4 chickens, fish, a bird, and a mouse or two. I enjoy people and need to have something to do typically or I will get bored quickly.
